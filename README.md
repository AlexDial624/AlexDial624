ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Alex, a third-year student at The University of Texas at Austin studying MechE with a certificate in Computer Science and a certificate in Data Sciences. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to better understand our world and do productive things in it.

ðŸ“š Currently, I'm focused on my cerificate courses and learning a [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) Udemy course. My latest repository on Chrome Webtime Tracking is an original work built on my experience so far with the course.

ðŸŒ± I'm looking to grow my knowledge of data science and machine learning, and I intend on eventually competing in the [MineRL](https://minerl.io/diamond/) challenge aimed at developing various aspects of artificial intelligence within Minecraft, engaging with challenges like environments with lots of hierarchy, tasks where rewards are sparse, and tasks where rewards are hard to define.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me at AlexDial@utexas.edu!
