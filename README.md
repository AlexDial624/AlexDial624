ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Alex, a senior at The University of Texas at Austin studying MechE with minors in Computer Science and Data Science. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to better understand our world and do productive things in it.

ðŸ“š Currently, I'm working part-time at Dun & Bradstreet doing software engineering for their Finance Analytics platform, while finishing out my studies, and co-leading my university's Effective Altruism (EA) student group.

ðŸ’» A recent project of mine has been developing tools that both develop my technical skills while serving our EA group. In one of these, I built a Slack bot to manage our group's coffee chat pairings, and in another, I built a Twilio project to manage member signup and event announcements more effectively over text.
