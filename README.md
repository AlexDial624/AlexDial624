ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Alex, a second-year student at The University of Texas at Austin pursuing Mechanical Engineering with a certificate in Elements of Computing. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to better understand our world and do productive things in it.

I've built several google sheet programs designed to translate data into readable and useful information. Recently, I've discovered there's a career that aligns with this passion!

Currently, I'm focused on my cerificate courses and learning a [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) Udemy course.

I'm looking to grow my knowledge of data science and machine learning, and I eventually intend on participating in the [MineRL](https://minerl.io/diamond/)
